            The <strong>2nd International Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW)</strong> brings together researchers
            from different academic disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets and their
            ecosystems; learn about novel analytics methods spanning all layers (P2P network, consensus, on-chain,
            off-chain); and discuss open challenges and possible future directions. Since cryptoasset analytics has
            become relevant across disciplines, we envision this workshop as an interdisciplinary venue, also connecting
            to cross-cutting issues related to law, ethics, privacy, and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program of CAAW 2023 workshop (co-located with TheWebConf2023) features a mix of invited talks and a
            selection of peer-reviewed research contributions. Workshop topics range from empirical studies, over
            analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical
            aspects. Scientists and professionals from all disciplines and sectors are invited to share their knowledge
            and experience in this niche intersection of Cryptoassets and Analytics through this workshop, as well as in
            the future iterations of CAAW.

            <p>This workshop solicits submissions related to cryptoassets and their ecosystems. This includes empirical
              studies, analytics methods and tools, case studies and use cases, interfaces to web technologies, reusable
              datasets and cross-cutting issues.</p>
            <h3>Topics & Themes</h3>
            <p>Topics and themes of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Empirical studies</span> that address various aspects of cryptoassets, blockchains,
                and related phenomena by measuring them, leading to new insight into system characteristics or user
                behavior. This includes, for example,</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Cryptoasset networks, compositions, and dependencies</li>
                <li>Smart contract interactions and dependencies</li>
                <li>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems like stablecoins, lending protocols, derivatives, and
                  decentralized exchanges</li>
                <li>Transitions between DeFi protocols</li>
                <li>Cross-chain interactions like bridges and atomic swaps</li>
                <li>Layer-2 systems like off-chain networks and rollups</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Analytics methods and tools</span> at are suitable to be reused as part of future
                analytics processes, set new benchmarks, or significantly simplify basic analytics. Examples include:
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Address clustering techniques</li>
                <li>Anonymization and identification</li>
                <li>Dataset extraction and labeling tools</li>
                <li>Smart contract analysis (e.g., symbolic execution)</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Case studies and use cases</span> that focus on specific actors, protocols,
                services, or other phenomena that emerge, for example, in the following areas:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Markets and exchanges</li>
                <li>Virtual Worlds, Blockchain-based Metaverses and Gaming</li>
                <li>Security breaches</li>
                <li>Fraudulent activities</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Cryptoassets and the Web</span> where Web technologies and standards interface with
                blockchain and technology and cryptoassets. Examples include:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Interfaces between traditional web payments and cryptoassets</li>
                <li>Adoption and use of cryptoasset-related Web applications</li>
                <li>Impact of cryptoassets on Web security and privacy</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Datasets</li> that are suitable to be reused or may become benchmark datasets
              against which new methods can be evaluated and compared. Such datasets consist of, e.g.:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Account labels</li>
                <li>Transaction labels</li>
                <li>Timeframe labels</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Cross-cutting issues</li> that exceed the scope of computer science and pay tribute
              to the interdisciplinary aspect of cryptoasset analytics, such as:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Legal and ethical aspects</li>
                <li>Economics and econometrics</li>
                <li>Sustainability</li>
