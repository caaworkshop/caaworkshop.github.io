Call for Research Papers

1st International Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW), co-located with
the TheWebConf 2023 (formerly WWW), Austin, Texas, USA
May 1 - May 2, 2023

https://caaw.io/2023/

*************************************************************************

The Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW) brings together researchers from different academic disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets and their ecosystems; learn about novel analytics methods spanning all layers (P2P network, consensus, on-chain, off-chain); and discuss open challenges and possible future directions. Since cryptoasset analytics has become relevant across disciplines, we envision this workshop as an interdisciplinary venue, also connecting to cross-cutting issues related to law, ethics, privacy, and security.

The workshop program will feature a mix of invited talks and a selection of submitted research contributions. Scientists and professionals from all disciplines and sectors are invited to share their knowledge and experience.

** Topics & Themes **

Topics and themes of interest include but are not limited to:

Empirical studies that address various aspects of cryptoassets, blockchains, and related phenomena by measuring them, leading to new insight into system characteristics or user behavior. This includes, for example,
* Cryptoasset networks, compositions, and dependencies
* Smart contract interactions and dependencies
* Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems like stablecoins, lending protocols, derivatives, and decentralized exchanges
* Transitions between DeFi protocols
* Cross-chain interactions like bridges and atomic swaps
* Off-chain networks and rollups

Analytics methods and tools that are suitable to be reused as part of future analytics processes, set new benchmarks, or significantly simplify basic analytics. Examples include,
* Address clustering techniques
* Anonymization and identification
* Dataset extraction and labeling tools
* Smart contract analysis (e.g., symbolic execution)

Case studies and use cases that focus on specific actors, protocols, services, or other phenomena that emerge, for example, in the following areas:
* Markets and exchanges
* Virtual Worlds, Blockchain-based Metaverses and Gaming
* Security breaches
* Fraudulent activities

Cryptoassets and the Web where Web technologies and standards interface with blockchain technology and cryptoassets. Examples include:
* Interfaces between traditional web payments and cryptoassets
* Adoption and use of cryptoasset-related Web applications
* Impact of cryptoassets on Web security and privacy

Datasets that are suitable to be reused or may become benchmark datasets against which new methods can be evaluated and compared. Such datasets consist of, e.g.:
* Account labels
* Transaction labels
* Timeframe labels
along with details on dataset generation, data quality, and ethical considerations.

Cross-cutting issues that exceed the scope of computer science and pay tribute to the interdisciplinary aspect of cryptoasset analytics, such as:
* Legal and ethical aspects
* Economics and econometrics
* Sustainability

** Research Papers & Submission Guidelines **

The Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW) welcomes submissions of papers documenting novel scientific research relevant to the topics of the conference. Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. The review process is double-blind. The submitted document should not include any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to: acknowledgements, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s) etc. Submissions not complying with this guidance will be desk-rejected.

We welcome three types of submissions:
* Full Papers:
Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages in length (maximum 8 pages for the main paper content + maximum 2 pages for appendices + maximum 2 pages for references).
* Short Papers:
Short paper submissions must not exceed 8 pages in length (maximum 6 pages for the main paper content + maximum 1 page for appendices + maximum 1 page for references).
* Posters: Poster submissions must not exceed 3 pages in length (maximum 2 pages for the main paper content + maximum 1 page for appendices).

The papers must be formatted according to the instructions below. Papers not complying to the page limits or not following the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected.

Submissions will be handled via Easychair, at https://easychair.org/conferences/submissions?a=29997377. Please take some time to include appropriate keywords for your submission.

The submitted abstract and the selected topics are leveraged to find adequate reviewers for submitted papers. Please write an email to contact@caaw.io, if you have any questions.

** Formatting instructions **

Submissions must adhere to the ACM template and format published in the ACM guidelines at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, Microsoft Word users may use the Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users may use the sample-sigconf template. 

Submissions for review must be in PDF format. They must be self-contained and written in English. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines, or do not view or print properly, will be rejected without review.

** Publication policy **

The proceedings of the workshops will be published in the conference proceedings (companion volume), which are archived in the ACM Digital Library.

** Important dates **

Submission deadline: February 6, 2023 (11:59 PM Anywhere on Earth)
Acceptance notification: March 6, 2023
Camera-ready version: March 20, 2023
Workshops: May 1-2, 2023
